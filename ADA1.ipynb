    "This notebook is the first of two lab notebooks that you will submit as part of your assessment for the Advanced Data Analytics unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is contains three sections:\n",
    "1. **Word embeddings:** This will introduce you to loading and training word embeddings using the Gensim library.\n",
    "2. **Introducing neural text classifiers:** Here we show you how to construct a neural network text classifier for sentiment analysis using Pytorch. \n",
    "3. **Improving neural text classifiers:** This section gives you a chance to improve the classifier from the previous section by applying what we have learned in the lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "These sections will contain tutorial-like instructions, as you have seen in previous text analytics labs. On completing these sections, the intended learning outcomes are that you will be able to...\n",
    "1. Load pretrained word embeddings models.\n",
    "1. Learn word embeddings from an unlabelled dataset.\n",
    "1. Recognise the steps required to train and test a neural text classifier with Pytorch\n",
    "1. Adapt the architecture of a neural text classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started -- Python Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see the README.md file for instructions on setting up your Python environment. The readme will instruct you to install the required packages, in addition to those used for Introduction to Data Analytics:\n",
    "\n",
    " * pytorch=1.9.0\n",
    " * scipy=1.8.0\n",
    " * transformers=2.1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside each of these sections there are several **'To-do's**, which you must complete for your summative assessment. Your marks will be based on your answers to these to-dos. Please make sure to:\n",
    "1. Include the output of your code in the saved notebook. Plots and printed output should be visible without re-running the code. \n",
    "1. Include all code needed to generate your answers.\n",
    "1. Provide sufficient comments to understand how your method works.\n",
    "1. Write text in a cell in markdown format where a written answer is required. You can convert a cell to markdown format by pressing Escape-M. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some unmarked 'to-do's that are part of the tutorial to help you learn how to implement and use the methods studied here. These do not contribute to your final marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Good Academic Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow [the guidance on academic integrity provided by the university](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/academic-advice/academic-integrity/).\n",
    "You are required to write your own answers -- do not share your notebooks or copy someone else's writing. Do not copy text or long blocks of code directly into the notebook from online sources -- always rewrite in your own way. Breaking the rules can lead to strong penalties. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Marking Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The coursework (both notebooks) is worth 30% of the unit in total. \n",
    "1. There is a total of 100 marks available for both lab notebooks. \n",
    "1. This notebook is worth 50 of those marks.\n",
    "1. The number of marks for each to-do out of 100 is shown alongside each to-do.\n",
    "1. For to-dos that require you to write code, a good solution would meet the following criteria (in order of importance):\n",
    "   1. Solves the task or answers the question asked in the to-do. This means, if the code cells in the notebook are executed in order, we will get the output shown in your notebook.\n",
    "   1. The code is easy to follow and does not contain unnecessary steps.\n",
    "   1. The comments show that you understand how your solution works.\n",
    "   1. A very good answer will also provide code that is computationally efficient but easy to read.\n",
    "1. You can use any suitable publicly available libraries. Unless the task explicitly asks you to implement something from scratch, there is no penalty for using libraries to implement some steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Support\n",
    "\n",
    "The main source of support will be during the remaining lab sessions (Fridays 3-6pm) for this unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The TAs and lecturer will help you with questions about the lectures, the code provided for you in this notebook, and general questions about the topics we cover. For the marked 'to-dos', they can only answer clarifying questions about what you have to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "Office hours: You can book office hours with Edwin on Mondays 3pm-5pm by sending him an email (edwin.simpson@bristol.ac.uk). If those times are not possible for you, please contact him by email to request an alternative. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Deadline\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook must be submitted along with the second notebook on Blackboard before **Wednesday 24th May at 13.00**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to zip up this notebook and the next notebook into a single .zip file, which you will submit to Blackboard through the 'assessment, submission and feedback' link on the left sidebar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please name your files like this:\n",
    "   * Name this notebook 'ADA1_\\<student_number\\>.ipynb'\n",
    "   * Name the zip file '\\<student_number\\>.zip'\n",
    "   * Please don't include your name as we want to mark anonymously to ensure fairness. "

    "\n",
    "This section shows you how to implement a neural network classifier using Pytorch and leads you through the steps required to process text sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several big advantages to building a text classifier using a neural network:\n",
    "   * It can model nonlinear functions, so can handle much more complex relationships between features and class labels.\n",
    "   * It performs representation learning: the hidden layers learn how to extract features from low-level data.\n",
    "   * It can process sequences of tokens -- we don't have to think in terms of a single feature vector representing a document as we did for logistic regression.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The downsides are:\n",
    "   * Much more expensive to train and test.\n",
    "   * It can overfit very badly to small datasets.\n",
    "   * The features learned by the hidden layers can be hard to interpret, which can make it hard to predict the model's behaviour, e.g., what sort of cases it may fail on.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Let's start by building a neural network text classifier that takes a sequence of tokens as input, and predicts a class label. For simplicity, it will use a single fully connected feedforward layer. "

    "The first step -- as always -- is to get our data into the right format. We start from a set of tokenised documents (in this case, tweets), where each document is represented as a sequence of text tokens. The neural network cannot process the tokens as strings, so we need to convert each token to a numerical input value. The input value for each token is used to look up the corresponding embedding in the embedding layer. For PyTorch, it's not necessary to create one-hot vectors for each token, as library just uses the indexes of the words in the vocabulary to look up the corresponding word embedding. \n",
